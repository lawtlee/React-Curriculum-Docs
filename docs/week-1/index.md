In the first Week, we will go over the basics of HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are the core of web development. 
No matter what framework you use, sveltekit, angular, vue, react, next, HTML and CSS will be the core component
and programming that you will do when it comes to building screens.

In modern day web programming, we don't write websites in HTML but rather Typescript and use HTML to display our designs.
The following pages will give you a quick overview of what HTMl and CSS is and how to use them with some examples
and challenge problems.
