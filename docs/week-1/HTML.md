HTML is considered the building blocks of a website. It is the base of what you see, the words, boxes, and gridlines. By itself, HTML is really ugly
and has not much purpose.

# Elements

HTML is built up of elements. These are how to describe what you are building (i.e. paragraphs, headings, links, containers).
For example the text:

"Hello World! This is a paragraph in HTML" is actually represented as this in code:
```
<p>Hello World! This is a paragraph in HTML</p>
```

There are multiple different types of elements in HTML, here is a list of the most commmon ones:

### Containers
```
<div> - a regular container
<section> - another regular container but makes code easier to read and understand
```

### Text
```
<p> - start of a paragraph
<i> - start of italicized text
<b> - start of bolded text
<u> - start of underlined text
```

### Headings
```
<h1> - Heading 1
<h2> - Heading 2
<h3> - Heading 3
<h4> - Heading 4
<h5> - Heading 5
<h6> - Heading 6
```

### Misc
```
<a> - used for links
<span> - used to apply certain styles to the elements inside of the span
```

There are more elements than these, but these are the basic elements that most pages use.

## Containers

Containers are the most sophisticated parts of HTML.
